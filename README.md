# Database-Project
Database implementation from scratch

# Modeling Language
The Model represents a Onlineshop and is designed with ER (Entity-Relationship) Modelling

# Technology Stack
The Database (relational database) is based on Oracle SQL.
The Database was implemented using Java and PHP. PHP was used to represent the Front-end Design of the Website and Java was used as data generator, to fill the database with information.
The data is stored in a csv file (this represents the situation in the most practical way) and is loaded into the database using the Java data generator.
